Tusken Gear Mod
        
        A mod which adds tusken raider apparel and weapons.
        
        All Star Warsâ„¢ references are made in pure love for the franchise and not in pursuit of profit

- All items are crafted at machining table.
- Rifle got a huge (really huge) range, mediocre damage and very long windup.
- Armor and headgear are supposed to be worn in hot climates as they provide high temperature resistance. 
- Female headgear can be worn by male colonists.
